# Lehman-Publications
Following some requests I have uploaded to this repository a list of Lehman publications that I was involved in writing along with Arthur Berd, Robert McAdie, Marco Naldi, Lutz Schloegl, Saurav Sen, Claus Pedersen, Stuart Turnbull and the rest of the quant credit team. They were first published around 20 years ago.
I hope they can still be of some benefit.
