# Lehman-Publications
Following some requests I have uploaded to this repository a list of Lehman publications that I was involved in writing along with Lutz Schloegl, Saurav Sen, Robert McAdie and the rest of the quant credit team. They were first published around 20 years ago.
I hope they can still be of some benefit.
